                            Thanks for stopping by. My name is Nanto. I am originally from Madagascar.
                            I left my big island (bigger than metropolitan France in surface) at the age of 18 in 2017.
                            Since then, I have lived in Paris, Lyon and Sophia Antipolis.

                            I am currently an engineering student at the Ecole Centrale de Lyon. I'm in a gap year since April 2022.
                            Before entering ECL, I did a double degree in math and physics at the University of Paris-Est-Creteil.
                            I am interested in privacy preserving machine learning and data privacy.
                            If you have any interesting coolaborations, feel free to shout me out.

                            For almost 7 years, I am a photographer and graphic designer in my spare time.
                            What I like is to immortalize my travels and make people feeling emotions through photos.
                            Plus, I create graphic identity and event posters when friends and family kindly ask me.
